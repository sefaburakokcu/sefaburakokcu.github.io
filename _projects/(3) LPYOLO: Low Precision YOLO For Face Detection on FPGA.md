description: In this project, official LPYOLO:Low Precision YOLO for Face Detection on FPGA is implemented and pretrained weights are shared. Models are trained by Brevitas which is a PyTorch research library for quantization-aware training (QAT) and exported to Onnx. FINN which is an experimental framework from Xilinx Research Labs to explore deep neural network inference on FPGAs is used for deploying models on a PYNQ-Z2 board.
