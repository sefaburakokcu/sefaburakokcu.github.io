# **About Me**

<br>Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am currently working as a Deep Learning Engineer with a strong background in developing efficient Deep Learning-based algorithms to tackle complex computer vision problems. In addition, I hold a Master's degree in Cognitive Science with a focus on Multitask Learning (MTL) and Continual Learning (CL). I am deeply passionate about the field of Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs).

I love learning new things and sharing them with others, which is why I started this blog. As I improve myself in Deep Learning and Software Engineering, I will share my experiences here. Additionally, I will add some tutorials and projects based on Deep Learning.

If you have any question or want to learn about me, you can reach me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sefaburakokcu/).
