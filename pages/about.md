# **About Me**

<br>Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer who designs Deep Learning algorithms for Computer Vision problems. In addition, I'm studying for a master's degree in Cognitive Science Department at [Orta Doğu Teknik Üniversitesi(ODTÜ)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/).

I love learning new things and sharing them with others. That is why I started a blog. I am improving myself in Deep Learning and Software Engineering, I will share my experience here. Also, I will add some tutorials and projects which are based on Deep Learning.

If you have any question or want to learn about me, you can reach me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sefaburakokcu/).
