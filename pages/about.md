# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm currently working as a software engineer who designs Deep Learning based computer vision algorithms. In addition, I'm studying for a master's degree in Cognitive Science at Orta Doğu Teknik Üniversitesi(ODTÜ).

I love learning new things and sharing knowledge with others. That is why I started a blog. I am improving myself in Deep Learning area and I will share my experience here. Also, I will add some tutorials and projects which are based on Deep Learning.

If you have any question or want to learn about me, you can reach me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sefaburakokcu/).
